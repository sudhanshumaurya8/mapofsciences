        <h1>A Structured Map of Scientific Knowledge</h1>

        <p class="subtitle">
          Navigate concepts through hierarchy, relationships, and context —
          not through isolated pages.

        <p class="description">
          Map of Sciences organizes scientific and engineering disciplines as
          explicit conceptual structures. Each field is represented as a
          navigable tree, allowing learners and researchers to understand how
          ideas relate, branch, and accumulate across levels of depth.

      <h2>Why Map Knowledge This Way?</h2>

      <div class="why-grid">
        <div class="why-card">
          <h3>Explicit Structure</h3>
          <p>
            Concepts are placed within a visible hierarchy, making prerequisite
            relationships explicit rather than implicit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="why-card">
          <h3>Context Before Detail</h3>
          <p>
            Each topic is approached first through its position in the larger
            structure, reducing fragmentation and improving long-term understanding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="why-card">
          <h3>Scalable by Design</h3>
          <p>
            The system is designed to grow gradually across disciplines, depths,
            and specializations without losing coherence.
