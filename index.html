        <h3>Structure over Search</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of searching blindly, see how concepts connect,
          branch, and evolve across disciplines.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Designed for Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          Built for students, researchers, and educators who
          think in systems, not pages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Expandable by Design</h3>
        <p>
          A foundation that can grow to millions of concepts,
          enriched gradually with context and references.
